The goal of dfo is to facilitate the reading of several file formats used by
the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO), Canada.

## Installation

<!--
You can install the released version of dfo from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("dfo")
```
-->

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("dankelley/dfo")
```
## Example

The following reads, summarizes, and plots an IOS-formatted CTD
file that is provided with the package. (Type `?read.ctd.ios` in
an R console for more details.)
```{r example}
library(dfo)
file <- system.file("extdata", "2007-019-055.ctd", package="dfo")
ctd <- read.ctd.ios(file)
summary(ctd)
plot(ctd)
```
